# Qianlong's World
This repository will contain the game collaboratively developed in Paul Vierthaler's "Building Qianlong's World" class at William & Mary in Spring 2024.

## Organizational ethos

### Developing process
Before you make any changes, be sure to create a new branch in GitHub desktop. Make all of the changes you would like, and when you are ready to have them added to the main game, make a pull request. Please remember to routinely pull remote changes into your version of the game.

As you make changes, be sure to commit them frequently! It is best to have an individual commit for each thing you change.

### Levels
When you add a level create a folder with your name, and place the level scene within it. Keep your scripts local to this file. 

### Assets
Models, materials, textures, etc should go in their respective assets folder. 

#### Prefabs
When you build a Godot scene that you think can be reused across levels, please save it into the "prefabs" folder. First add a folder for the general category if it doesn't exist, then add it there.
